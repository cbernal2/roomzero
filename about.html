  <p><i>Room 0</i> began in the first room I have ever called my own.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In an off-campus student house—complete with all its expected quirks and a house cat—the room on the top floor, with the entrance to the attic, became the inspiration for this archive. But like any archive, it isn’t just a place. It’s a practice.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A practice of the process of noticing, naming, remembering, and creating.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 60px; color:#2e6139;"><i><b>Behind the Screen</b></i></h4>

  <p>Behind the screen is a fourth-year <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/arts/cts" target="_blank">Culture & Technology Studies</a> major, with a minor in English, at the University of Guelph—academically drawn to documentation, archiving, and the unseen architecture behind every ordinary thing. <i>Room 0</i> is where those concerns take shape: quietly, and sometimes contradictorily.</p>
 <br>

<br>
  <h4 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 60px; color:#2e6139;"><i><b>The Practice</b></i></h4>

  <p>This project moves between order and doubt, caught between the impulse to collect and the wisdom of letting go. It offers no tidy answers—only the restless spaces where contradictions dwell, where the act of storing becomes a kind of remembering, and remembering becomes a form of creation.</p>
<br>

  <br>
  <p>Built with a sensibility toward <a href="https://katherinemartinko.substack.com/p/what-is-digital-minimalism" target="_blank">digital minimalism,</a> <i>Room 0</i> resists the logic of infinite scrolls and empty gestures. In an age of overproduction and digital excess—where everything is saved, copied, and shared until it loses shape— this site chooses stillness. It is <a href="https://hygraph.com/blog/what-is-a-static-website" target="_blank">static,</a> sustainable, and deliberately spare.</p>
  <br>
  <p>But the spareness is not always visible. The design gestures towards maximalism, characterized by layers, ornamentation, and occasional clutter by design. This contrast is part of the project, as it reflects the actual space in which the site was created. What appears abundant is carefully measured. What feels chaotic is held in structure. </p>
   <br>

<br>
  <h4 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 60px; color:#2e6139;"><b><i>An Ethics of Attention</i></b></h4>

  <p>All of the content here is original. That matters—not solely for ownership, but for integrity too. The digital sphere is a ubiquitous space of sharing; therefore, we ought to question more how we store, shape, and sustain the things we make.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Think of this space as a kind of speculative archive—one that’s less about keeping things safe, and more about asking why they were kept in the first place.</p>
<br>
   
   <hr style="width: 50%; margin: 20px auto; border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #704f33;">
  

<br>
  <h4 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 60px; color:#2e6139;"><i><b>The Next Room: Disclaimer !</b></i></h4>

  <p>Not every artifact that you find in this archive will arrive with context. Some items may remain unnamed, uncaptioned, or unresolved—not out of oversight, but because this is a living work, and an archive in practice. <i>Room 0</i> will continue to unfold as I move in, out, and through other rooms, and other versions of myself. What is here now is only the beginning—a partial record, open to revision, refusal, and return.</p>
