    <blockquote> 
      <p><i>"Bought this in Vermont when visiting our cousins. Michelle moved out there when her husband, Michael, was doing his residency as an anethesiologist at the Dartmouth University hospital. </i></p>
      <br>

      <p><i>Dartmouth is an Ivy league school like, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Cornell. You gotta be really smart to get in that school. I bought this at their campus store when he was showing us around. That same trip, we were playing road hockey on their street with roller blades. They lived on a street that faced a lake which looked exactly like <a href="https://fridaythe13th.fandom.com/wiki/Camp_Crystal_Lake" target="_blank">"Camp Crystal Lake"</a> (Google it). </i></p>
      <br>

     <p><i> Michael told us "sometimes youll see Jason Voorhees walking down the street" ... CREEPY! Anyways, the ball was rolling down the street so I tried to save it from rolling even further. So I was going really fast on roller blades when one skate clipped the grass and I crashed into the base of this big tree, shoulder first. I ended up separating my shoulder so, Michael took me to his hospital and fast-tracked for X-rays and treatment. In and out in less than an hour!</i> </p>
     <br>

      <p><i>So the rest of the trip my right shoulder was in a sling. I still have the sling that everyone signed! I'll show you it!"</i></p>

    <br><br>

    <p>This is one of my favourite sweaters.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It really belongs to my Dad, but I took it from him when I moved away to University in 2022. I like it because of the colours and its oversize fit—but I've come to appreciate it even more because of his memory attatched to it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While collecting data for this project, I sent my parents photos of various items I have that originally belonged to them (see more in the <a href="../clothes.html" target="_blank">Clothes Collection</a>). It was interesting to observe the contrast in their responses. For example, my Mom's recollections were short, concise, and often number-based—how old she was when she got the item, what year it was, or how many yeats ago it happened (see <a href="bags.html" target="_blank">(put a specific bag)Bags Collection</a> for examples). In contrast, my Dad's responses were more narrative-driven, full of annecdotes and always anchored by a fond memory.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What made this particularly inteesting is that, between the two of them, my Dad isn't usually considered the "talker". He tends to be more quiet and observant, while my mom is typically the one bubbling with stories, often beginning conversations with "I remember this one time..."</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is something meaningful about how this reversal played out during this project—how objects can quietly carry stories, and how the right question, or the right moment, can invite even the quieter voices to speak.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This process reminded me that memory doesn't always live where we expect it to; it hides in fabric, in old logos, in the way something fits just right.</p>
