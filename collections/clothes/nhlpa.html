      <h3><i>... from my Dad, via WhatsApp. June 23rd, 2025</i></h3>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><i>"I can't remember which Roots I got this from. Maybe STC. Roots clothing last forever."</i></p>

    </blockquote>
  <br><br>

  <p> STC stands for <a href="https://scarboroughtowncentre.com/" target="_blank">Scarborough Town Center,</a> one of the largest regional shopping centers in Toronto's east end. It is strategically positioned next to Canada's busiest highway—the 401— it serves as a one-stop shopping destination for the more than 22 million shoppers that visit annually. </p>
  <br>
  <p>STC has been a central fixture in the Scarborough district of Toronto since it opened in 1973. My Mom emigrated to Canada in 1971, my Dad in 1975. Before they knew each other, they lived on opposite ends of the same crescent in Scarborough. My Dad, and his motorcycle buddies would ride through the neighbourhood, revving their enginges, while my Grandpa—before he was my Grandpa—cursed their noise. </p>
  <br>
  <p><a href="https://www.roots.com/ca/en/our-story.html" target="_blank">Roots</a> is a Canadian brand that is known for its comfort and quality, it has been around since 1973, the same year that STC opened. These quiet coincidences and overlapping timelines tell a story about a place where new beginnings quietly took root—where families like mine built lives from scratch, where malls like STC weren't just places to shop, but common spaces to work, create memories, and meet people you didn't know you were going to know forever.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I took this sweater from my Dad when I moved to University in 2022, I liked it because it was thin, comfortable, and oversized. I don't care much for Hockey. This sweater, like many things in my family's story, is something that has been passed down (or stolen), worn through different phases of life, and still holds up.</p>
