>...Bought this in Vermont when visiting our cousins. Michelle moved out there when her husband, Michael, was doing his residency as an anethesiologist at the Dartmouth University hospital. Dartmouth is an Ivy league school like, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Cornell. You gotta be really smart to get in that school. I bought this at their campus store when he was showing us around. 
>
> That same trip, we were playing road hockey on their street with roller blades. They lived on a street that faced a lake which looked exactly like "Camp Crystal Lake" (Google it). Michael told us "sometimes youll see Jason Voorhees walking down the street" ... CREEPY! 
>
>Anyways, the ball was rolling down the street so I tried to save it from rolling even further. So I was going really fast on roller blades when one skate clipped the grass and I crashed into the base of this big tree, shoulder first. I ended up separating my shoulder so, Michael took me to his hospital and fast-tracked for X-rays and treatment. 
>
>In and out in less than an hour! 
>
>So the rest of the trip my right shoulder was in a sling. I still have the sling that everyone signed! I'll show you it!
