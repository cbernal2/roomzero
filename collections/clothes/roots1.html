  <br><br>

  <p> This is an XXL Roots hoodie. It is way too large on me and fits more like a big nightgown rather than a hoodie. Before it lived in my closet, I took it from my Mom, who got it from her cousin — my Kuya Ronnie.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Technically, I should be calling him <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tito" target="_blank"><i>Tito</i></a>, the Filipino word for <i>Uncle</i>, but Growing up My Kuya Ronnie was always over. We would bake banana bread and play cards — I always won in Crazy 8's and he would swear I was cheating. He would help me with anything I asked, and entertain the silliest requests I had.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kuya" target="_blank"><i>Kuya</i></a> in Tagalog means <i>elder brother.</i> While I have three actual older brothers, I never really call them "Kuya". I mainly use it as a respectful address for an older man.<p>
  <br>
  <p> While I was growing up, I didn't find much common ground for activities with my brothers. They would crowd around the Xbox playing games that involved guns, zombies, soliders—taking turns passing around one controller after one of them died in the game. So, I would revert to doing quieter things on my own: arts & crafts, reading, writing, or simply watching my brothers play. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Except when Kuya Ronnie would come over—he too preferred watching rather than participating. But together, we would sew, cook, play checkers, clean, and bake. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Naturally, now that I am away from home, I begin to forget about the small but, meaningful, moments I experienced while growing up. Items such as this comically large hoodie remind me of those times—especially during the cold, dark, Canadian winters, when comfort like this is needed the most.</p>
