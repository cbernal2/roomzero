  <p>Interestingly, this old digital camera has recently become a new addition to my hobby list. </p>
  <br>
  <p>My Grandpa gave this to me in my second year of University. Frankly, I asked for one because digital cameras had made a comeback due to the aesthetic of the pictures. The mid 2020's saw a revival of the Y2K aesthetic-- late 90's and early 2000's fashion design began its resurgance on platforms like TikTok and Depop. According to this <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/y2k-fashion" target="_blank">Vogue article,</a> this comeback stems from Gen Z's fascination with the asethetics of their childhood and/or their older siblings' eras.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Yes, this camera made its way to me mainly for aesthetic reasons but, in using it I found that it captures moments more accurately to how they look and feel in real life. As opposed to my iPhone, which automatically obscures the image with the phone's pre-set camera settings that are annoyingly diffuclt to customize and often interfere with the process of photo taking. Anyone with an iPhone will agree that the camera never does the scenery justice, and that there is always a grey-ish, dull, feel to the image.</p>
  <br>
  <p>But, digital cameras have re-emerged because they bring the life back to images, we begin to see the world in colour as saturated as we did when we were little. Although there are a fair amount of settings that can be toyed with on digital cameras, I, personally, have never altered them. Possibly a rookie mistake and I might be missing out on greater image capturing opportunities, but it's simplicity and accurate refelction of feeling is where its importance lies.</p>
