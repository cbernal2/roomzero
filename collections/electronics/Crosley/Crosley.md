This record player was a gift for my 16th birthday. The gifter, somebody that I no longer know, had actually bought it from another friend, it was used but in great shape, and I have continued to maintain its condition throughout the years. That same somebody, as I have mentioned, would begin a tradition of buying me records for my next two birthdays and a couple Christmases. 

Since my birthday is in June, every 6 months I would gain another record in my collection. This was a special gesture that opened my eyes to the idea of loving someone by supporting their individual interests and the intentions that produce traditions.
