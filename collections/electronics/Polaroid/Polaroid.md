This "ancient" piece of technology has no clear owner or origin, it circulated through several members of my family while I was growing up. When I was little, I didn't care too much for photography or capturing moments, because no child is concerned with making a point to remember certain times. However, I do remember that once my oldest brother taught me how to peek through the lens and snap a photo. 

The first and last picture I remember this camera taking was of my childhood dog Coco, who passed away in 2019. 

This polaroid now sits atop my bookshelf as its sole purpose now is for memory and display. The correct peel-apart film for Land Cameras is no longer in production. You might be able to find older, expired film for these cameras but that would risk quality issues and consume a lot of time and money. Polaroids were the initial instant cameras, the only way people could capture memories. As time passes and digital advancements continue to emerge, the act of shaking the picture to "help it" develop, film cameras in general, and past pets become a forgotten memory.
